#pragma mark OEEventsObserver delegate methods

// What follows are all of the delegate methods you can optionally use once you've instantiated an OEEventsObserver and set its delegate to self. 
// I've provided some pretty granular information about the exact phase of the Pocketsphinx listening loop, the Audio Session, and Flite, but I'd expect 
// that the ones that will really be needed by most projects are the following:
//
//- (void) pocketsphinxDidReceiveHypothesis:(NSString *)hypothesis recognitionScore:(NSString *)recognitionScore utteranceID:(NSString *)utteranceID;
//- (void) audioSessionInterruptionDidBegin;
//- (void) audioSessionInterruptionDidEnd;
//- (void) audioRouteDidChangeToRoute:(NSString *)newRoute;
//- (void) pocketsphinxDidStartListening;
//- (void) pocketsphinxDidStopListening;
//
// It isn't necessary to have a OEPocketsphinxController or a OEFliteController instantiated in order to use these methods.  If there isn't anything instantiated that will
// send messages to an OEEventsObserver, all that will happen is that these methods will never fire.  You also do not have to create a OEEventsObserver in
// the same class or view controller in which you are doing things with a OEPocketsphinxController or OEFliteController; you can receive updates from those objects in
// any class in which you instantiate an OEEventsObserver and set its delegate to self.
